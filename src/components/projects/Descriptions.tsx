        projectDescription: `
            The program simulates gravitational force, 
            electrostatic force and allows for elastic collisions.
            The dynamic quantity of particles can be arranged in shapes 
            such as: circle, square, diamond, spiral, loose spiral, 
            sunflower spiral. Finally, the shapes can then also be 
            divided and rotated.`

            The program fetches data from OpenWweatherMap API API and
            displays the daily information overview and detailed 
            information. Further, a 24 hours and 7 days forecast for 
            temperature and precipitation, is displayed in a carousel 
            container along with bar graphs respectively.`

            Simulation and analysis of diffusion of cell membrane proteins 
            in different confinement models for a McGill research project. The 
            program first simulates the molecular landscape, then applies 
            Gaussian filters to reproduce real microscopy images. Finally, 
            a Gaussian surface decay is animated over time.`
