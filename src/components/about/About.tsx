                    I started my academic journey as a Honors Physics undergraduate. 
                    I was set on pursuing a carreer in particle physics, but realized
                    overtime that software engineering is the real deal. Since I 
                    still enjoy physics nevertheless, I decided to pursue a major in
                    Physics and Computer Science at McGill University, where I will be 
                    graduating in December 2022.

                    I am big fanatic of the LaTeX markup language. I have taken class notes 
                    in real-time with it for most of my classes at McGill and used it to 
                    write all of my school work. My most notable project is the Notes for
                    MATH 314 (Advanced Calculus), a document that was featured to the class
                    by my teacher.
